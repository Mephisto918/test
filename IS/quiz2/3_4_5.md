# 1. Machine Learning Basics

## Machine Learning

- is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the developement of computer algorithms that improve automtically through experience and by the use of data

### <ins>**Examples**</ins>:

1. Facial Recognition
2. Product Recommendation
3. Email Authentication and spam filtering
4. Social Media Optimization
5. Healthcare Advancement

### <ins>**Types of Machine Learning**</ins>:

- <ins>**Supervised Learning**</ins>

  - is a category of machine learning that uses labeled datasets to train algorithms to predict outcomes and recognize patterns

- <ins>**Unsupervised Learning**</ins>

  - is a type of machine learning that learns from data without human supervision

- <ins>**Reinforced Learning**</ins>

  - (RL) is a type of (ML) where an agent learns how to make decision by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions, recieves rewards or penalties based on thos actions, and adjust its behavior over time to maximize cumulative rewards. This learning process follows the trial-and-error approach

## Metrics for Learning Algorithms

- are essential for assessing the performance of machine learning models. Choosing the right metric depends on the type of problem-classification, regression, or clustering. In real-world applications, the wrong metric can lead to misleading reports and poor decision-making

### <ins>**Types of Evaluation Metrics & Their Use Cases**</ins>

- <ins>**Classification Metricss (e.g.. Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)**</ins>

  - Used when the output is a category (e.g.. spam/not spam, fraud/not fraud)

- <ins>**Regression Metrics (Used for Continuous Predictions)**</ins>

  - Used when the output is a continious value (e.g.. preceeding house price, stock prices)

- <ins>**Clustering Metrics (Used for Unsupervised Learning)**</ins>

  - Used when the model groups similar data points without labeled outputs (e.g. customer segmentation, anomaly detection)

### Real Life Examples:

#### Banking:

##### Better Evaluation Metrics:

- Precision: Measures how many flagged fraud cases are actually fraud.
- Recall: Measures how many real fraud cases the model catches.
- F1-score: Balances precision and recall for a better overall measure.

# 2. Reasoning In Intelligent Systems

## Inference Mechanisms: Forward and Backward Chaining

### <ins>**Forward Chaining**</ins>

- Forward chaining is also known as a forward deduction or forward reasoning method when using an inference engine
- The forward-chaining algorithm starts from known facts, triggers all rules whose premise are satisfied and adds their conclusion to the known facts.
- It follows an if-then logic, where it checks if a rule's condition match existing facts, then applies the rule to generate new knowledge
- This process repeats until the problem is solved

### <ins>**Backward Chaining**</ins>

- Backward chaining also known as backward deduction or backward reasoning method when using an inference engine
- In this, the inference engine knows the final decision of goal
- It looks for a rule tha concludes the goal and then checks if the rules conditions are met
- The system starts from the goal and works backward to  determin what facts must be asserted so that the goal can be achieved

## Bayesian Networks and Probabilistic Reasoning

- understanding how machines work under uncertainty

### <ins>**Bayesian Networks**</ins>

- are graphical models that represent probabilistic releationships between variables using a <ins>**_directed acyclic graph (DAG)_**</ins>. They are widely used in AI and decision-making to handle uncertainty by updating beliefs based on new evidence

### <ins>**Probabilistic Reasoning**</ins>

- is a method of making logical inferences using probability thoery, allowing systems to reason under uncertainty

### <ins>**_THOMAS BAYES (1701-1761)_**</ins>

- and english statistician and thoelogian. He developed <ins>**_Bayes' Thoerem_**</ins>, which describes how to update probabilities based on new evidence

- his work was alter formalized and expanded by <ins>**_Pierre-Simon Laplace_**</ins>, who applied it more broadly to probability theory. The modern concept of <ins>**_Bayesian Networks_**</ins> was introduced by <ins>Judea Pearl</ins> in the <ins>**1980s**</ins> as a way to model probabilistic reasoning in AI

#### What are <ins>BAYESIAN NETWORKS?</ins>

- are a type of <ins>**Probabilistic Graphical Model**</ins> that can be used to build models from data and/or expert opinion using a <ins>**direcy acyclic graph (DAG)**</ins>
- they can be used for wide range of tasks including diagnostics, reasoning, casual modeling, decision making under uncertainty, anomaly detection, automated insight and prediction
- <ins>**Key Concepts**</ins>:

  - <ins>**Nodes (Random Variables)**</ins> - Representing possible states of knowledge
  - <ins>**Edges (Conditional Dependecies)**</ins> - Showing how variables influence each other
  - <ins>**Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs)**</ins> - Quantifying relationships between variables

### Applications of Bayesian Network

- <ins>Autonomous Systems</ins>
- <ins>Financial Risk Analysis</ins>
- <ins>Medical Diagnosis</ins>
- <ins>Spam Filtering</ins>

## Temporal Reasoning

- is the ability to understand and analyze relationships between events in time. It involves processing temporal information, recognizing patterns and trends, and making informed decisions based on temporal relationships

- according to <ins>**Egnati**</ins>, temporal reasoning enables intelligent systems to "<ins>**_understand the order in which evetns occur, the duration of events, and the relationships between events_**</ins>"

### Examples:

- Scheduling: allocating time slots for tasks or events
- Planning: determining the sequences of actions to achieve a goal
- Predicting outcomes: forecasting the results of a sequence of events
- Time series analysis: analyzing data points collected over time to identify trends and patterns

## Spetial Reasoning

- is the ability understand and analyze relationships between objects in space. It involves processing spatial information, recognizing patterns and shapes, and making informed decision based on spatial relationships
- according to <ins>**Engati**</ins>, spatial reasoning enables intelligent systems to "<ins>**_understand the relationships between objects in space, such as proximity, distance, orientation, and shape_**</ins>"

### Examples:

- Object recognition: identifying objects and their properties
- Navigation: determining the best route between locations
- Mapping: creating and interpreting spatial representations
- Image processing: analyzing and understanding visual data from images and videos

# 3. Ethical and Societal Implications

## Ethical and Societal Implcations

- refers to the moral and social consequences of technology and actions on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. It involves considering how decisions, innovations, or behaviors may impact fairness, privacy equatlity, and the overall well-being of people and the environment. This includes addressing issues like bias, accountability, and the effects on employment, privacy and security

### Bias, Fairness and Accountability in Intelligent Systems

- Bias, fairness, and accountability are essential to making AI and machine learning ethical and responsible. Bias happens when AI favors one group over another due to flawed training data, leading to unfair outcomes. Fairness ensures AI treats everyone equally, preventing discrimination. Accountability means developers and companies must take responsibility for AI decisions, ensuring transparency and the ability to fix biased outcomes. These principles help create trustworthy, fair, and ethical AI systems that benefit society.

### Privacy and Security Challenges 

- Intelligent systems face privacy and security challenges in protecting personal data. Privacy issues arise when data is collected without consent, while security risks involve breaches or cyberattacks. To protect users, strong security measures, safe infrastructure, and clear privacy policies are needed to maintain trust and safeguard personal information.

### Impact on Employement and Workforce

- AI and automation are changing the job market by improving efficiency but also replacing some human tasks. This can reduce demand for certain skills while creating new opportunities in tech fields. To adapt, workers need to reskill and upskill, ensuring a balance between automation and human labor to minimize job loss.

### Ethical Use of AI in Decision-Making 

- Ethical AI in decision-making ensures fairness, transparency, and accountability. It must avoid discrimination, respect privacy, and provide clear explanations for its choices. This is especially important in fields like healthcare, finance, and law enforcement, where AI decisions can greatly impact people's lives.
