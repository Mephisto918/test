"<ins>**_The self is the brain_**</ins>"

- the mind does not really exist
- the self is the brain

#### Maurice Meleau Ponty

"<ins>**_The self is the brain_**</ins>"

- mind-body bifurcation that has been going on for a long time is futile endeavor and an invalid problem

- the self can never be truly objectified or known in a completely objective sort of way
- the self is embodied subjectivity
