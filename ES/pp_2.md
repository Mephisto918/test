# Chapter 2: The Environmental and Oganism

## Ecology

The study of the relationships between organisms and between oraganism and their environment\
An ecosystem is a set of organisms interacting with each other, as well as with the environment in which they live\
It involves all interaction between living and non living components of the biosphere

## Types of Echosystems

1. Microecosystem
2. Mesoecosysem
3. Macroecosystem
4. Global Ecosystem

### 1. Microecosystem

It involves small streams and glades

### 2. Mesoecosysem

Represents sea, pond, wood and river

### 3. Macroecosystem

It involves oceans and continents

### 4. Global Ecosystem

Represents the Biosphere as a whole

## Parameters of Ecosystem

- A change in any of the above parameters causes a disbalance in the stability of the ecosystem which can become a very important condition to human life with time. The factors that disrupt these parameters are of varios kinds
- A set of ecological factors that help to provide the normal vital activity(parameters) of given kind of organisms called <ins>**_ECOLOGICAL NICHE_**</ins>

### 1. QUALITATIVE

- It represents the variety of specie of an ecosystem i.e. all the different species of living organisms present in a ecosystem

### 2. QUANTITATIVE

- It represents the number of a given specie of a organism in the ecosystem

## ECOLOGICAL FACTORS

1. ECOLOGICAL OPTIMUM
2. ECOLOGICAL PESSIMUM
3. ECOLOGICAL SPECTRUM
4. ECOLOGICAL VALENCY

### 1. ECOLOGICAL OPTIMUM

- The zone of ecological optimum is a range of values of ecological factors optimal for vital activity of the given specie

### 2. ECOLOGICAL PESSIMUM

- These are zones of supression of vital activity. They are generally found aboce or below the value of an ecological factor

### 3. ECOLOGICAL SPECTRUM

- The ecological spectrum of specie is a set of ecological valencies on different ecological factors. Due to ecological spectrum, specie can be classified into eurybiontic, having wide spectrum and stenobiontic, having a narrow spectrum

### 4. ECOLOGICAL VALENCY

- This represents the range zone of optimum for each ecological factor for a given specie of organisms

## TROPHIC CHAINS

- This trophic chain is a chain of transmission of energy or substance from low-organised to a high-organized organisms in an ecosystem. 

### Every trophic chain is composed of 4 levels which include:

- <ins>**PRODUCERS:**</ins> This represents organisms which are able to manufacture their own food. A classical example of organisms falling in this group are plants
- <ins>**PRIMARY CONSUMERS:**</ins> They feed on producers and are hence herbivorous organisms. An example is a Goat
- <ins>**SECONDARY CONSUMERS:**</ins> They can either be omnivorous or carnivorous because they feed on both producers and primary consumers or produces respectively. Example lion and man
- <ins>**DECOMPOSERS:**</ins> These organisms feed exclusively on dead organic matter of plants and animals

### Types of Trophic Chains

- There are basically two types of trophic chains:

    1. DIRECT FOOD CHAIN

      - This is a direct feeding relationship between all levels of the trophic chain in which each organism has a single source of food
      - The stability of this trophic chain can easily be disrupted if one of the organisms is lacking

    2. FOOD WEB

      - The stability of this trophic chain can easily be disrupted if one of the organisms is lacking

### Importance of Trophic Chains

1. They form an important component of the ecosystem
2. Producers are important sources of food in an ecosystem
3. The organisms in an ecosystem help to keep a balance between all the gases released in the atmosphere
4. They also protect the ozone layer by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released to the atmosphere
5. Other oganisms reduce the degree of water pollution which could be very risky for man

## What do you mean ENVIRONMENT?

The environment is made up of two things:

1. <ins>**Abiotic Factors:**</ins> Non-living (never was living) Examples: rocks, water, air, weather, sunlight, sand, and temperature
2. <ins>**Biotic Facors:**</ins> Living, once living things or part of a living organism. Examples: leaves, trees, poop, whales, flowers, mushrooms

## ORGANISM

- Any unicellular or multicellular form exhibiting all the characteristics of life, an individual
- The lowest level of organization in ecology

## SPECIE

- All the organisms of a single kind (plant, animal, or mircobe)
- Organisms can and do mate and produce fertile offspring

## POPULATION

- A group of individuals of the same specie that live in a gicen area and interbreed
- Example: Wolves of Yellow Stone Part, The ants at AISE, Plumeria's in Cairo

## BIOTIC COMMUNITY(BIOTA)

- All the living organisms that live in a particular area
- Includes vegetation to animals to mocroscopic creatures such as backterias
- Depend on one another

## ECOSYSTEMS

- An interactive complex of the communities and the abiotic environment affecting them withing a particular area

## ECOTONES

- The transition area between two ecosystems
- Shares amny characteristics between both ecosystems

## BIOMES

- A large are of Earth's surface with the same climate and similar vegetation

## BIOSPHERE

- The overall ecosystem of the Earth
- All ecosystem are interconnected through gloval processes such as the water cycle and the atmospheric cycle
