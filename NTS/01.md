# Learning to be a Better Learner

## What is Learning?

<ins>**_Learning_**</ins> is the process of acquiring knowledge, skills, behaviors, or attitudes through study, experience, or teaching. It involves understanding new information, applying it in different situations, and adapting based on feedback. Learning can be intentional (structured education) or unintentional (experiences and observations) and occurs throughout life.

## **Metacognition** - concept created by <ins>**_John Flavel_**</ins>

- commonly defined as <ins>**_"thinking about thinking"_**</ins>, it is the awareness of the scope and limitation of your current knowledge and skills

## Aspects of Metacongnition (accorning to Paris and Winnograd 1990)

1. <ins>**_self appraisal_**</ins> - your personal reflection on you knowledge and capabilities
2. <ins>**_self management_**</ins> - the mental process you employ using what you have in planning and adapting to successfuly learn or accompplish a task

## Elements of Metacognition (in accordning to American Insititute for Research 2010)

1. <ins>**_Metacognitive Knowledge_**</ins> - what you know about what you think

    1. <ins>**_Personal Variables_**</ins> - evaluation in strength and weaknesses in learning
    2. <ins>**_Task Variables_**</ins> - Waht you know or what you think about the nature of the task, as well as the strategies the task requires
    3. <ins>**_Strategic Variables_**</ins> - how you adjust your thinknig processs to help you learn better

2. <ins>**_Metacognition Regulation_**</ins> - how you adjust your thinking processess to help you learn better

## Skills to Improve Metacognitive Skills (according to Waterloo Student Success Office)

1. <ins>**_Know Your Limits_**</ins>- Evaluate what you know and waht you do not know. Knowing the scope and limitations of your resources allows you to work with what you have at the moment and look for ways to cope with other neccessities
2. <ins>**_Modifying your Approach_**</ins>  - Recognize which strategies are inappropriate with the task, you might want to change or modify it
3. <ins>**_Skimming_**</ins>  - Browse over a material and keep an eye on keywords, phrases, or sentences. It is also about knowing where to searh fo such key terms
4. <ins>**_Rehearsing_**</ins>  - This is not ust about repeatedly taking, writing, and doing what you have learned, but also trying to make a personal interpretation or summary of the learning experience - thoerized and apply
5. <ins>**_Self-test_**</ins>  - This does not only focus on what youhave learned but also on how you learned it. "What strategies did I use?". "How successful were my learning strategies?". "How can i further improve my learning skills?"

## Four Types of Metacognitive Learners
  
1. <ins>**_tacit_**</ins>   - unaware of their metacognitive processes although they know the extent of their knowlegde
2. <ins>**_aware_**</ins>  - know some of their metacognitive strategies but do not plan on how to these techniques
3. <ins>**_strategic_**</ins>  - strategize and plan their course of action toward a learning experience
4. <ins>**_reflective_**</ins>  - reflect on their thinking while using strategies and adapt metacognitive skills depending on their situation
