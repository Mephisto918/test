## **_Definition of Intelligent Systems_**

An **_Intelligent System_** refers to a system designed to perceive its environment, reason about the information it gathers, and take actions to acheive specific goals or solve problems. These systems can adapt to changing conditions, learn from experience, and improve their decision-making over time. The primary goal is to mimic aspects of human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, perception, and decision-making, using computational methods and algorithms. In essence, intelligent systems are designed to think, learn, and make decisions similar to human, allowing them to perform complex tasks with minimal human intervention.

### **_TLDR:_**

An **_Intelligent System_** is a system that perceives its environment, learns from experience, and makes decisions to achieve goals with minimal human intervention, mimicking human intelligence through reasoning, learning, and decision-making.

## Components of Intelligent System

1. **_Sensors/Perception:_**
    - **_Function:_** The system must sense and collect data from its environment to understand it. This involves using sensors(e.g. cameras, microphones, temperature) to gather real-world information
2. **_Data Processing:_**
    - Once the data is collected, it must be processed and interpreted to make sense of it. This involves transforming raw data into useful information for decision-making
3. **_Knowledge Base:_**
    - A knoledge base is a structured collection of data facts, rules, and heuristics that helps the system make informed decisions. It acts as the system's memory or repository of information
4. **_Reasoning(Inference Mechanism):_**
    - Reasoning allows the system to apply logic or mathiematical models to analyze information and make decision. It involve deriving conclusion from the knowlegde base
5. **_Learning:_**
    - Intelligent Systems are often equiped with the ability to learn from experience or data. This learning capability allows them to improve their performance over time adapt to new environment, or update their knowledge.
6. **_Decision Making:_**
    - Once the system has gathered information, processed it, and reasonsing through it, it needs to make decision. This component is responsible for evaluating options and selecting the best course of action
7. **_Actuatory/Action:_**
    - **_Function:_** After making a decision, the system must take action of influence its environment. Actuators are the components that allow the system to interact with physical world or take actions based on the decision made
8. **_Feedback:_**
    - Feedback helps the system evaluate the results of its actions and adjust its behavior accordingly. Feedback can com from the environmant or the system itsef(self-assessment)


## **_HISTORY AND EVOLUTION OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS_**

### **_Early Developement_**

The formal study of intelligent systms began in the <u>**mid-20th century**</u> with the advent of computers and the field of artifical intelligence(AI). The groundwork for inteliigent systems was laid by pioneering researchers who sought to create machins capable of mimicking human intelligence

### **_Key Milestons_**

1. **1950s-1960s:** The birth of AI as a field, marked by <u>**_Alan Turing_**</u>'s seminal paper **_"Computer Machinary and Intelligence" (1950)_** and the development of the first AI program, such as the <u>**_Logical Thoerist_**</u> and the <u>**_General Problem Solver_**</u>
2. **1970s-1980s:** The rise of expert systems, which used rule-based reasoning to solve complex problems in specific domains. This period also saw the developement of early machine learning algorithms
3. **1990s:** The emergence of data-driven approaches, with advancements in neural networks and the introduction of support vector machines. The field of robotics also saw significant progress
4. **2000:** The profilation of big data and the advent of deep learning revolutionized inteliggent system Technique such as <u>**_convulutional neural netork (CNNs)_**</u> and <u>**_recurrent neural networks (RNNs)_**</u> enabled breakthroughs in image and speech recognition
5. **2010s-Present:** The integration of AI into everyday life, with applications in virtual assistance, autonomous vehicle, and smart home devices. The developement of <u>**_reinforcement learning_**</u> and <u>**_generative adversarial netowrk (GANs)_**</u> further expanded the capabilities of intelligent systems
