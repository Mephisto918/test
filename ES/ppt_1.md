# Introduction to Enviromnmental Science

## **_Environmental Science_** is the study of **_HUMAN IMPACT_** on the environment

A major goal of **Environmental Science** is to understand and solve <u>environmental problems</u>.

### **_Environmental Science_** is an <u>interdeciplinary science</u> - it involves many other fields of study

including:

- history
- social sciences
- earth science

<br>

## Important Foundation of ES

### Ecology

- the study of <u>living things</u>, <u>nonliving things</u>, the <u>environment</u> and their <u>interactions</u>.

<br>

## Our Environment Through Time

- As Society has changed its impact on the environment has changed 

### <u>Hunger-Gatherers</u>

- Small groups of people that migrate from place to place
- Obtained food by collecting **plants**, **hunting** or **scavenging**
- Impact on the environment:
  - burned grasslands to maintain **prairies** for hunting
  - overhunting of some game animals
  - took plants from their native areas

For the most part Hunter-gatherers lived in Harmony with their environment

### <u>Agricultural Revolution</u>

- was a time in human history when people practiced agriculture, this occured all over the world

**_AGRICULTURE_** is the growing of plants and breeding of animals for human use

#### <u>Effects of the Agricultural Revolution:</u>

&emsp;Impact on the environment:

- More pressure on local environments
- Habitats were distroyed for farmlands
- Changed species from their wild ancestors, plants and animals were domesticated

&emsp;Impact on society:

- Population increased
- People began to concentrate in small areas

### <u>Industrial Revolution (1760 to 1850)</u>

- was a time when animals, humans and water were replaced as major energy sources by fossil fuels
- it was a shift in energy sources

**_Industrialization_** - the development of industry on an extensive scale
**_FOSSIL FUELS_** - come from the remains of plants and animals

#### <u>Effects of the Industrial Revolution</u>

&emsp;Impact of environment:

- Pollution first became a problem
- More waste and trash to dispose of
- Disease was a problem in many cities

&emsp;Impact of environment:

- Populations in urban areas grew
- Life improved, sanitation, nutrition and medicine
- Inventions:
  - light bulb
  - telephont
  - computer

_Much of Environmental Science is concerned with the problem associated with the industrial Revolution_

## <u>Resource Depletion Pollution Loss of Biodiversity</u>

### &emsp;<u>3 Main categories of environmental problems:</u>

- Resource Depletion
- Pollution
- Loss of Biodiversity

### <u>Resources</u>

Natural resources is any natural material used by humans such as:

- wood
- water
- soil
- plants
= animals

&emsp; 3 types of Resources:

- <u>Perpetual Resources</u> - will continue forever like sun and wind
- <u>Renewable Resources</u> - can be replaced relatively quickly by natural process
- <u>Non-renewable Resources</u> - form at a slower rate than the rate it is consumed:
  - fossil fuels:
    - coal
    - oil
    - natural gas

### <u>Pollution</u>

Any undesired change in the air, water, soil, that adversely affects the health and survival of humans and other organisms

&emsp; 2 main types of pollutants

- <u>BIODEGRADABLE</u> - organic material that can be broken down by natural process:
  - food
  - waste
  - sewage
  - leaves
  - newspaper
  - cotton
  - clothing
- <u>NONBIODEGRADABLE</u> - inorganic material that connot be broken down by natural processes:
  - mercury
  - lead
  - most plastics
  - glass
  - synthetic clothin

### <u>Loss of Biodiversity</u>

<u>**_Biodiversity_**</u> refers to the number and variety of species that live in an area
<u>**_Extinction_**</u> is a natural process, whereby all members of a species die
<u>**_Mass Extinction_**</u> - large scale extinction
<u>**_Threatened Species_**</u> - likely to become endangered
<u>**_Endangered Species_**</u> - in danger of extinction

## Economics and the Environment

Social pressure influence how we use resources so do economic pressures

<u>**_Law of Supply and Demand_**</u> - the greater the demand for limited supply of something, the more that thing is worth
<u>**_Cost-Benefit Analysis_**</u> - balances the cost of the action against the benefit one expects from it 
<u>**_Risk Assessment_**</u> - how does the public perceive the risk of the environmental problem.
<br>
<u>**_DEVELOPED COUNTRIES_**</u>

- Highly industrialized
- High incomes
- High standards of living
- Slower population growth
- Good medical care

<u>**_DEVELOPING COUNTRIES_**</u>

- Less industrialized
- Average income is low
- Standard living is low
- Agriculture based economics
- Faster population growth
- Poorer medical care

<u>**_Population and Consumtion_**</u> - most environmental problems can be traced back to 2 root causes:

- POPULATION PRESSURES
- CONSUMPTION TRENDS

<u>**_Sustainable World_**</u> - a world in which humans can continue to exist indefinitely with a high standard of living and health
