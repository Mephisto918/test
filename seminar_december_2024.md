### **What is a research topic?**

A <u>**_research topic_**</u> is a focused and well-defined subject or area of interest that serves as the foundation for a research project

It represents a specific issue, question, or problem within a broader field of study that research investigation, analyze, and seek to understand

A well-chosen research topic is the starting point for any research endeavor, and it guides the entire research process, from formulating research questions to data 
collection, analysis, and the creation of a research paper or thesis.

### <u>**_Characteristics of a Good Research Topic_**</u>

- Relevance to the field
- Specificity
- Originality and uniqueness
- Feasibility
- Interest and Motivation
- Social and ethical significance
- Clarity and precision
- Testability
- Relevance to personal goals
- Resources and support
- Current and timely
- Manageable scope
- Potential for contribution to the society

### **What is a research title?**

- A research title, also known as a research paper title or study title, is a concise and 
informative phrase or sentence that succinctly describes the main focus, subject, or 
theme of a research study. 
- It serves as the first and most prominent part of a research paper, thesis, or academic 
publication, providing readers with a clear idea of what the research is about.

### **Primary purpose of a research title**

1. <u>**_Convey the Research Focus:_**</u> It gives the reader an immediate understanding of the specific area of research or the central question being addressed.
2. <u>**_Attract Attention:_**</u> A well-crafted title can capture the interest of potential readers or researchers, encouraging them to explore the research further.
3. <u>**_Indicate the Scope:_**</u> The title often hints at the scope and context of the research, such as the geographic region, specific subject matter, or the key elements under 
investigation.
4. <u>**_Facilitate Search and Indexing:_**</u> In academic and professional databases, titles are used 
as search terms. A clear and descriptive title makes the research more discoverable.
5. <u>**_Provide a Framework:_**</u> It can guide the development of the research paper, helping the researcher stay focused on the central theme.

### **Related Literature**

A <u>**_"Review of Related Literature"_**</u>, often referred to as a <u>**_"Literature Review"_**</u>, is an essential component of research, academic papers, theses, and dissertations. It involves a comprehensive and critical examination of existing scholarly work, research, and publications relevant to the subject or topic of the research.

### **Primary Purpose of Review of Related Literature**

- <u>**_Establish Context:_**</u> It sets the context for the research by providing an overview of the existing body of knowledge and research on the subject. This helps readers understand the historical development and current state of the field.
- <u>**_Identify Gaps:_**</u> It identifies gaps, inconsistencies, and unanswered questions in the existing literature, which can guide the direction of the current research.
- <u>**_Provide Theoretical Framework:_**</u> A literature review can serve as the theoretical framework for a research project. It introduces theories, concepts, and models relevant to the research
- <u>**_Support Claims:_**</u> It supports and substantiates the research claims, hypotheses, or research questions with evidence and insights from previous studies.
- <u>**_Build Credibility:_**</u> It enhances the credibility and academic rigor of the research by demonstrating the depth of understanding and engagement with prior work in the field.

## **Key Elements of Literature Review**

- <u>**_Inclusion of Relevant Sources:_**</u> A literature review includes a broad range of sources, such as academic papers, journal articles, books, theses, reports, and relevant online materials.
- <u>**_Organization and Structure:_**</u> The review is organized thematically, chronologically, or by research methodologies, depending on the goals of the research.
- <u>**_Critical Analysis:_**</u> It involves a critical analysis of each source, evaluating its strengths, weaknesses, and contributions to the field.
- <u>**_Synthesis of Information:_**</u> A literature review doesn't just summarize existing work; it synthesizes information, highlighting patterns, trends, and overarching themes.
- <u>**_Identification of Gaps:_**</u> The review identifies gaps in the existing literature where new research can make a valuable contribution

### **Steps in Literature Review**

1. Define the Scope: Clearly define the scope and objectives of your literature review. What specific aspect of the topic are you researching?
2. Search and Select Sources: Conduct a comprehensive search for relevant sources using academic databases, libraries, and online resources. Select sources that are directly related to your research topic.
3. Evaluate and Analyze: Critically evaluate the quality and relevance of each source. Consider the research methods, sample size, data analysis, and the credibility of the authors.
4. Organize and Synthesize: Organize the selected sources into a coherent structure, highlighting the main findings and themes. Synthesize the information to provide a clear overview of the existing knowledge.
5. Identify Gaps and Research Questions: Identify gaps or areas where further research is needed. Formulate research questions based on these gaps.
6. Write the Review: Compose the literature review section of your research paper or thesis, ensuring it flows logically and adds value to your research.
7. Cite Properly: Provide appropriate citations and references for each source used in the review, following the required citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, IEEE).

### **Review of Related Research Studies**

Related Studies are from researches or from official public offices, and thesis from different universities and libraries. In startup-based research projects, related studies refer to existing alternatives that provide direct or indirect solutions to the research problem, or solutions that serve as “inspiration” to your proposed study.
